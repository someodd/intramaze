# Currently limited to Fourmolu 0.4.0.0 because of nixpkg compatibility
# limitations as of 2022-08-27.
#
# Would like this once a newer Fourmolu is available in nixpkgs: function-arrows: leading
indentation: 4
comma-style: leading # for lists, tuples etc. - can also be 'trailing'
record-brace-space: false # rec {x = 1} vs. rec{x = 1}
indent-wheres: false # 'false' means save space by only half-indenting the 'where' keyword
diff-friendly-import-export: true # 'false' uses Ormolu-style lists
respectful: true # don't be too opinionated about newlines etc.
haddock-style: multi-line # '--' vs. '{-'
newlines-between-decls: 1 # number of newlines between top-level declarations
